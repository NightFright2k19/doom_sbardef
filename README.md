**SBARDEF HUD MOD FOR WOOF!**

The Nightdive port brought the possibility to edit the HUD/statusbar via SBARDEF. Unfortunately, the editor which is supposed to make statusbar modding a lot easier is still not completed. Bottom line: I couldn't wait for it and went ahead to create the HUD I wanted/needed.
Woof! is the intended port for this mod and AFAIK there are currently no other "non-Nightdive" ports which support SBARDEF.

How to use:
- Unzip the archive into your Woof! installation directory. Files will be copied into the proper autoload subdirectories.
- Launch Woof! and keep pressing F5 until you get to the HUD you want.

Available variants:

**1) Nightdive-Like with Labels**
   ![nightdive_doom](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afdae6b6-5975-42b1-a227-3ab43c0dc97e)
   ![nightdive_hacx](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7db04c46-b59d-4e66-80a9-e9c61da69b3d)
   This one replaces the Nightdive fullscreen HUD. To allow max compatibility with other (P/I)WADs, armor and ammo icons have been removed since they often end up being badly aligned/too large/etc. There are a few more features that were missing before, mainly ammo overview and weapons display. [HacX comes with an extra font since the standard numbers look like absolute trash in fullscreen mode.]
   
   Indicators:
   - Armor type: Green 33% / blue 50% in "Armor" label
   - Berserker mode: "1" in ARMS panel turns golden
   - Chainsaw/SSG possession: "8" and "9" in ARMS panel lit
   - Backpack found: Numbers in ammo overview turn golden

**2) ﻿Essentials Minimal/Compact/Distributed**

   ![essentials_compact](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/debb7289-8f09-45eb-966a-c09e5fd5df07)
   ![essentials_distributed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23b69c51-6c15-4d5c-a9ae-1c18df3f1e1d)
   K﻿eeps the mugshot, but focuses on the basic info provided by the original Nightdive fullscreen HUD to save more screen space. (Numbers are taken from the Eternity Engine.)
   Minimal: All relevant info aligned on the left side of the screen, similar to Boom Compact.
   Compact: For those who ﻿need all the info missing in Minimal, i.e. weapons + ammo overvi﻿ew.
   Distributed: Like Compact, but with weapo﻿ns﻿ and ammo overview shifted to the right scr﻿een ﻿corner﻿.
   
   Indicators:
   - Armor type: Armor number green (33%) or blue (50%)
   - Berserker mode: Infinity symbol turns﻿ red when fists are selected
   - Chainsaw/SSG possession (Compact/Distributed only): "1" and "3" in ARMS line lit/golden (Doom 2: gray if only SG or SSG owned, golden if both owned)
   - Backpack found: Ammo number turns golden
   - Invulnerability (powerup only): Health + Armor numbers turn golden
   
**3) Crispy with Labels**
   ![crispy_labels](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/642b3baf-b33e-4525-b78c-b95557d5f74b)
   Crispy HUD with labels - and that's it. No other changes. I've de﻿cided to replace the labels for the ammo types with weapon slot numbers to provide maximum compatibility with mods which change ammo names. [HacX uses the enhanced font from the Nightdive-like﻿ HUD.]

**4) Boom-Like Compact/Distributed**
   ![boom_compact](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50924c5e-878a-4646-ba29-ec36ff16349f)
   ![boom_distributed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0901317c-39f3-4c44-9a49-657049b68160)
   Lovers of the old Boom HUD may know and appreciate this one. Not exactly imitating the original by 100%, but with a bonus feature: Properly aligned keys (regardless which custom offsets are used in a PWAD).
   Compact: Everything aligned on the left side of the screen.
   Distributed: Ammo stats moved to the right side. Otherwise identica﻿l functions/features.
   
   Indicators:
   - Armor type: ARM number green (33%) or blue (50%)
   - Berserker mode: "1" in WEP turns green
   - Chainsaw/SSG possession: "8" and "9" in WEP lit
   - Backpack found: MUN numbers turn golden
   - Invulnerability (powerup only): Health + Armor numbers turn golden
   - Active ammo type: Ammo number highlighted in red
