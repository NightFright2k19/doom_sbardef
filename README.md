# SBARDEF HUD MOD FOR WOOF!

The Nightdive port brought the possibility to edit the Doom statusbar and fullscreen HUD via <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/SBARDEF" target= "_blank">SBARDEF</a>. Unfortunately, a proper editor for this purpose is still not completed. I couldn't wait for it and went ahead to create the HUDs I wanted, using nothing but Notepad.<br><br>
**If you want to use any (or all) of these HUDs in a mod of yours, feel free to do so. However, please be fair and credit me for my work. A lot of effort and time has been invested into this project.**<br><br>

**Intended ports:**
- <a href="https://github.com/fabiangreffrath/woof" target= "_blank">Woof!</a> (mod has been primarily developed for this port)<br>
- <a href="https://github.com/MrAlaux/Nugget-Doom" target= "_blank">Nugget Doom</a> (NUGHUD can only be toggled when the "PrBoom+ Balanced"-style HUD is selected)<br><br>

**How to use:**
- Unzip the archive into your Woof! installation directory. Files will be copied into the proper autoload subdirectories.<br>
- If you are using *extras.wad*, launch Woof! with command line parameter **-noextras**.<br>
- Keep pressing F5 ingame until you get to the HUD you want.<br>
- Note #1: For best visuals, be sure the "Wide Shift" slider ("Status Bar/HUD") in your Woof! menu is maxed out.<br>
- Note #2: Woof! does **not** support <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/ID24HACKED" target= "_blank">ID24HACKED</a>, so no extra weapon slots and fifth ammo type with PWADs requiring *id24res.wad*.<br><br>

**Features:**
- **Vitals**: Health, armor, ammo and keys. For all HUDs.<br>
- **Mugshot**: Animated face. Featured in Status Bar Plus, Nightdive, Eternity I and DSDA II/III.<br>
- **Ammo overview**: Amount of ammo available for each weapon. Partial in Nightdive and DSDA III (no max amounts), full in Status Bar Plus, Crispy, Eternity and DSDA I+II.<br>
- **Arms**: Available weapons. 2-7 in Crispy, 1-7 in DSDA III, otherwise 1-9. Either arranged as a square (Status Bar Plus, Crispy, Nightdive I) or a single line (Nightdive II, Eternity, Boom, DSDA, PrBoom+). DSDA II splits the display into two slot-grouped panels (1-2-3-8-9 / 4-5-6-7). A switch between panels occurs whenever a weapon of a different panel is selected. DSDA III indicates Chainsaw through a lit "1" in slot 1 and possession of both shotguns with a fully lit "3".<br><br>

**Indicators:**
- **Armor type**: Level of damage absorption. Shown explicitly as percentage in Crispy, Nightdive and Doom 64. Otherwise, armor number is usually recolored (green: 33%, blue: 50%). Status Bar Plus adds a small frame around the mugshot for this purpose. In Eternity II and PrBoom+, the armor icon changes instead.<br>
- **Backpack**: Powerup which doubles ammo amount. Recolored ammo numbers (white to gold/green) and/or doubling max ammo (Status Bar Plus, Crispy, Nightdive II, Eternity, DSDA I/II).<br>
- **Chainsaw/Super Shotgun**: Not shown on the vanilla status bar, these weapons are listed in the Arms display in more modern ports, usually as "8" and "9".
- **Berserk mode**: Powerup which increases punching power with Fists. Usually shown as a fully lit "1" in the Arms display. The green cross icon in Eternity II turns red. In PrBoom+ I, the Medikit icon is replaced by a Berserk pack. In Eternity and DSDA, the symbol (infinity loop or "N/A") turns red if fists are selected.<br>
- **God mode**: Mugshot and/or recolored health/armor numbers (gold). "Health" label in Crispy/Doom 64 switches to "God". In Eternity II and PrBoom+ II, icons turn golden, too.<br>
- **Active ammo/weapon**: Currently selected weapon and fitting ammo. Orange numbers in the Arms/WEA/WPN panel and/or ammo overview.<br><br>
